# computer-game-random-item-creator-with-factory-pattern

Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. 

When the programmers don't know what kind of objects will be needed. The Objects can be items, products, logistic-type etc.

In Factory pattern, we create object withouts exposing the creation logic to the client 
and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

The stated purpose of the Factory Patterns is: 

- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 

- Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
